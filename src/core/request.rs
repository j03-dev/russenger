//! The `request` module contains the `Req` struct, which represents a request from a user.
//!
//! The `Req` struct contains the following fields:
//! * `user`: A `String` that represents the user who made the request.
//! * `query`: A `Query` that represents the query made by the user.
//! * `data`: A `Data` that represents the data associated with the request.
//! * `host`: A `String` that represents the host from which the request was made.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Use the `Req` to get the user and data from a request:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use russenger::models::RussengerUser;
//! use russenger::prelude::*;
//!
//! #[action]
//! async fn HelloWorld(res: Res, req: Req) {
//!     let user: String = req.user;
//!     let message: String  = req.data.get_value();
//!     res.send(TextModel::new(&user, "Hello, world!")).await;
//! }
//!```
//! Use the `Req` to get the user and query from a request:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use russenger::models::RussengerUser;
//! use russenger::prelude::*;
//!
//! #[action]
//! async fn Main(res: Res, req: Req) {
//!     res.send(TextModel::new(&req.user, "What is your name")).await;
//!     req.query.set_action(&req.user, Name).await;
//! }
//!
//! #[action]
//! async fn Name(res: Res, req: Req) {
//!   let name: String = req.data.get_value();
//!   res.send(TextModel::new(&req.user, &format!("Hello, {}!", name))).await;
//! }
//!
//! #[russenger::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     let conn = Database::new().await.conn;
//!     migrate!([RussengerUser], &conn);
//!     russenger::actions![Main, Name];
//!     russenger::launch().await;
//! }
